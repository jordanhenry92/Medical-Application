# Medical-Application
Medical Application created in Python3 using PyQt5

This application is intended as practice for me to brush up on my Python and learn the PyQt5 framework.


TODO:

- Create the search feature for bothe patients and drugs.
- Design and implement the prescription feature.
- Modify the home tab so that it displays the current # of drugs and patients in the database.
- Add input masks for the addPatient and addDrugs windows so that only proper input is accepted.
